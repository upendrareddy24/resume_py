I'm excited about the Software Engineer at Amazon because the responsibilities align with my focus on building reliable, scalable systems. I blend ML/data engineering with strong software craft, which maps closely to your requirements around impact and execution. Recent work highlights include: • Proficient in Python, C++, JavaScript, Django, Flask, React JS, and cloud services across AWS and Azure. • Manage end-to-end software development life cycles with CI/CD, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Agile practices. • Architect data pipelines on Snowflake, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, and AWS serverless services for scalable analytics. Key strengths for this role: python, engineer, aws, docker, kubernetes. Amazon's emphasis on thoughtful engineering and real-world outcomes resonates with my approach. I'd value the chance to contribute quickly, collaborate across functions, and raise the bar on quality and speed.
