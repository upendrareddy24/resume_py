I'm excited about the Tririga Infrastructure Engineer, Close Systems at amazon because the responsibilities align with my focus on building reliable, scalable systems. I blend ML/data engineering with strong software craft, which maps closely to your requirements around impact and execution. Recent work highlights include: • Proficient in Python, C++, JavaScript, Django, Flask, React JS, and cloud services across AWS and Azure. • Designed scalable RESTful and GraphQL APIs for microservices architecture and real-time data aggregation. • Lead AI governance and MLOps initiatives using Databricks, Hex, GitLab, and Vertex AI to secure developer platforms. Key strengths for this role: java, javascript, api, data, engineer, aws, lambda, s3, ec2. amazon's emphasis on thoughtful engineering and real-world outcomes resonates with my approach. I'd value the chance to contribute quickly, collaborate across functions, and raise the bar on quality and speed.
